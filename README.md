Problem description:
Testing an API Gateway endpoint + Lambda

API END POINT:

The API URL is: "https://7dal3vydn7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/RestAWSRegionsAPI"


Scenario 1: The response statuscode will be 200 if request method is "GET" or "POST"
            The data in case of status code 200 is list of all aws regions and their information including availability zones in JSON format

Scenario 2: The response statuscode will be 400 if request method is "DELETE", "PUT", ...
            The body will be "Unsupported method" followed by the request method

To provide this solution I followed the steps as mentioned in the problem description using nodejs:
  
   1. Create a Node.js ES6 module to return all AWS regions and availability zones
  
   2. Use this module in an AWS Lambda function.
  
   3. Make the Lambda function available via an AWS API Gateway endpoint.
   
   4. Optionally Make response JSON:API 1.0 compatible.
   
   5. Optionally Wrap the Lambda, API Gateway endpoint, and utility module in a Serverless application. More info
   
   4. Develop an end to end API test for this API endpoint.
      * The test functions are located in test directory. The tests cover above scenarios.
      * The functions generated by postman code snippets.
      * I changed the tests to be run for the api and fullfill the pass and fail conditions.
